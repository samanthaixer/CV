## Samantha Ixer

Many years ago, in a galaxy far far away, I used to write Java code in a dark room for months on end without talking to people. I fled, joining the ranks of "Project Manager" at some big retailers. As time passed, I discovered that developers aren't locked away in dark rooms anymore, that pair programming and TDD exist and so I emerged, brave and ready to become a developer again. Somewhere along that journey, I also led an initiative at John Lewis to transform their IT department into an agile engineering capability. It's a journey, and the journey continues. 

## Skills

#### Leader of change and agility

I am one of the leaders at John Lewis who has led the journey towards agility, adopting early and iterative delivery of value with small teams that work together to achieve a common goal. 

- Working alongside some industry leaders such as Dan North, I have kicked off and led the "Organisational Agility" initiative to change John Lewis into a responsive and agile organisation
- Over a period of a few years we have moved from long waterfall software projects to small, iterative change and a completely different mindset. I challenge the norm and the "old school" and encourage new and innovative thinking
- "Small and iterative" is now the normal starting point for projects

#### Developer of people

My primary role, as well as learning code, is to develop the skills of others to help them and the organisation flourish. 

- I plan to run coding clubs for non-work projects to give people opportunities to practice different skills
- I provide encouragement, direction and feedback to help people build their skills and fulfil their potential
